## Lab Questions

- Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

  - Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed
  - It ensures that all of the tests are automatically checked everytime a new feature or bug has been fixed. It also catches if the code disrupted the pre-exisiting features and keep the main branch clean.

- 2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
  - No as an end to end test checks the entire application from the perspective of the user and a function returning the correct output should be tested with a smaller unit test
